      <p><em>
        This report is based on the redesign of a memory game. As you read this report feel free to take at look at the CodePen which has the original
        <a href="https://codepen.io/beumsk/pen/xdoKjX?editors=1112">Memory Game</a>

        <d-cite key="gnn-intro"></d-cite>
      </em></p>
      <p id="introduction">
       One example of a simple game that could be improved upon for a better user experience is a basic "memory matching" game where the player flips over cards to find matching pairs. Through user testing and iteration, our project will aim to enhance the overall user experience by addressing areas of improvement such as UI/UX design, game mechanics, and user engagement. The final deliverable will be a fully functional memory game that offers a satisfying and enjoyable user experience. 

      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Original System:</b>
A memory matching game is a game where the user gets to choose a theme that incorporates pictures related to it and start matching while a timer keeps track of the time the user takes to complete matching the pictures in the grid. The objective of this project is to design and develop a memory game application that prioritizes minimal user experience, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The original game uses a 4x5 grid with a pop up menu at the beginning for the user to choose a theme from. After that, the timer would start increasing (in seconds) which is presented at the bottom of the grid. Also, there is a points counter that increments by 10 points for every successful match. The title of the game is presented right above the grid in big font.

       </p>
       <b>Target Audience:</b>
       Anyone who enjoys playing fast paced casual games should enjoy playing this game. The rules are simple and there is next to no barrier of entry. Additional modes can account for people who prefer different play styles.
       
              </p>
       
       <b>Redesign System:</b>
       <p>The primary objective of a memory match game is to deliver an engaging and enjoyable experience that enhances users' memory and concentration skills. From a design perspective, the game must be intuitive, easily learned, and supplemented with distinct visual and auditory cues to facilitate seamless user navigation.
        In terms of usability, the game should cater to a diverse audience, including varying cognitive abilities and physical impairments. Customizable settings must be available for adjusting difficulty levels and personalizing the gaming experience. Moreover, the game must be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring consistency and smoothness across platforms.
        </p>
        <p>A key goal of the memory match game is to provide an immersive, challenging experience for players, offering an array of visual stimuli for memorization and accurate matching. To heighten engagement, multiple difficulty levels, achievements, and leaderboards for competition should be incorporated.
          From a design standpoint, the game requires a clear, intuitive interface with easily navigable and comprehensible feedback and visual cues. Aesthetically, an appealing and visually engaging game must include captivating graphics and animations for an immersive and enjoyable experience.
          </p>
        <p>Aesthetically, the game must present a visually pleasing and cohesive design, with crisp graphics and animations that are easily understood. Sound effects and music should be fitting and non-intrusive.
          Lastly, the game should furnish feedback and rewards for encouraging user engagement and motivation. A transparent scoring system should be in place for users to track progress and achieve a sense of accomplishment. Positive reinforcement via visual and auditory cues should acknowledge users' success and inspire continued play.
          </p>

          <p>In conclusion, a memory match game's primary aim is to offer an entertaining and engaging experience that hones memory and concentration skills while promoting competition and achievement. Through proficient design and development, the game can cater to players of all ages and skill levels, delivering an enjoyable and rewarding experience.</p>

Interaction
    </h2>
    <p>

      <h3>Interaction Metaphors</h3>

      <p> 
        The game utilizes the innovative concept of using a hand as a replacement for the traditional mouse cursor. This unique approach creates a highly immersive experience for the user, as it mimics the sensation of physically interacting with the game's visual components.
        
        By using this interaction principle, the user's hand appears to reach into the game's user interface and manipulate the cards as if they were physically present. This creates a highly engaging and dynamic experience that encourages the user to explore and experiment with the game's features.
        
        The presence of the hand cursor has an explicit value, as it not only serves as an advertisement for the available actions, but it also provides a clear indication of the user's current mode of interaction. This helps to reduce confusion and increases the user's confidence in their ability to interact with the game's interface.
        </p> <p> Furthermore, the use of the hand cursor as an explicit advertisement for available actions aligns with the principles of user-centered design, which emphasizes the importance of providing clear and explicit feedback to users. By explicitly advertising the available actions, the game ensures that users are able to quickly and easily identify opportunities for interaction and are encouraged to explore and experiment with the game's features.
        
        The game is reactive - The system is designed to be passive and waits for user action before reacting. This means that the game responds to user input in real-time, providing an instant and seamless experience.

Final Heuristics Evaluation Of System    </h2>

<h3>Visibility of System Status
  </h3>
  <p>  Our system effectively provides visual feedback to the user. Some examples of this include buttons highlighting and visually being “pressed down”, a selected tab of multiple possible tabs appearing bigger and highlighted, and the cards highlighting green or red depending on if they are a match. This allows the user to be informed about what the system is doing so they can make informed decisions.
  </p>
  <h3>Match Between the System and the Real World
  </h3>
  <p>  Our system utilizes the user’s “language” and follows real world conventions in regards to “flipping cards on a table”. Our system does not use technical or fancy/trendy words and instead uses simple yet concise language to effectively convey what things do/are. Some examples include “New Game” and “Continue” to start a new game or continue from where the user left off, using terminology relating to cards on a table like “card”, “flipping”, “table”, etc, and common language that would be found in settings such as “Difficulty”, “Volume”, etc, and much more. This allows the user to better understand what things do/are and provides information in a way that the user is familiar with.
  </p>
  <h3>User Control and Freedom
  </h3>
<p>Our system allows the user to back out of unwanted/accidental decisions. Some examples of this include a confirmation screen to make sure the user really wants to exit the webpage, and home buttons to return to the main menu from the many other screens. This gives users the freedom to move throughout the system and allows for user mistakes to be corrected.
</p>

<h3>Consistency and Standards</h3>
<p>
  Our system adheres to consistency and standards. It keeps both internal and external consistency. All interactable buttons highlight and/or slightly expand to notify the user that they are interactable. Interactable buttons also use universal skeuomorphic designs and appear about where they would be located on other games. For example, the close button is an exit sign and appears in the top right corner of the menu. This keeps everything consistent so that the user can easily learn and become familiar with the options available to them.
  </p>
   <h3>Error Prevention
	</h3>
  <p>Our system prevents the user from making mistakes. It allows for the user to back out of actions that they unintentionally and unwillingly entered. For example, the close button/action asks the user if they really want to exit if it is clicked. This stops user errors before they occur.
  </p>
<h3>Recognition vs. Recall in User Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Our system promotes user recognition and visually displays all possible actions to the user to help them recognize and understand what action to take to perform a specific task. For example, the system has buttons with icons that display what they do/are as opposed to having a command line where the user must memorize and input the action they want. This makes performing an action much easier as it is much easier to figure out what to do with the visual cues all present in order to perform that action.</p>
    
   <h3>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h3> 
    <p>
      Our system does not have any shortcuts or accelerators. However, our system is simple and all actions come in the form of buttons. Thus, there is not much need to make it any more flexible or efficient than it already is. Some buttons appear on multiple screens so they are accessible from anywhere as well, making it a little more flexible/efficient.</p>
    <h3>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
    <p>Our system follows aesthetic and minimalist design. We keep irrelevant and non-interactable information to a minimum and keep the signal-to-noise ratio high. For example, there are only buttons on the menu screen with the game blurred out in the background and the only other non-interactable piece of information is the logo/title icon of the game. This allows the system to effectively communicate with the user and minimizes clutter that can distract the user unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <h3>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors
    </h3>
    <p>This is similar to the error prevention heuristic. However, our system does not really have many places where the user can make an error. With the close action, we have a confirmation screen so the user can recover from errors, but aside from that, there is not anywhere else that the user can cause an error. So, our system does help users recover from errors, but there is not really a need to help the users diagnose errors.
    </p>

    <h3>Help & Documentation</h3>
    <p>
      Our system provides help and documentation that is easy to find and easy to understand. An example of this is our help button that can be found on the main menu and on the game screen. It shows the user how the game works and what they need to do in simple and easy to understand steps. This allows the user to better learn how the game functions and what the rules and goals are.

    <h2 id="recommendations">
Recommedations
    </h2>
      <p>The memory match game could use some cognitive load management: This could be done by minimizing the cognitive load placed on users by simplifying the game's interface and reducing the amount of information presented at any given time.
      </p>
      <p>Also, another one would be Social Interaction and Collaboration. The game already has a leaderboard implemented, but it could encourage social interaction by incorporating features such as multiplayer modes, and being able to post progress on social media (ex. Facebook) and be able to invite friends online to compete with. Providing users with the option to collaborate and compete with others, fosters a sense of community and engagement.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, responsiveness and adaptability are a good thing to have. The game so far adapts to a browser. But it could be optimized for different screen sizes, resolutions, and devices to provide a consistent user experience across various platforms. Next step could be employing responsive design techniques to ensure that the game adapts seamlessly to the user's device and environment.
      </p>
      <p>Another recommendation would be to integrate Gesture-based interactions for touch-enabled devices, such as swiping or tapping, to create a more immersive and natural user experience, by ensuring that these gestures are easily discoverable and consistent with the overall design of the game.
      </p>
      <p>Last but not least it is good to improve on user testing and feedback and that would be by regularly conducting user testing and gathering feedback from players to identify areas for improvement, uncover usability issues, and ensure the game meets the needs and expectations of the target audience. Thus, this feedback could be used to iterate and refine the game's design and features.</p>
